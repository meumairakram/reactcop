## "Over Engineering is not always the Best"

Following KISS rule in mind, ReactCop is just a ~~cutting-edge~~ simple boilerplate to get your React-Redux project started as easy as possible. It avoids all the unnecessary engineering and just keep the necessary things in.

ReactCop consists on the following abstractions out of the box:

- React
- Redux
- React Router Dom
- Redux Thunk
